## 🎯 How to Practice:

1. **Open the JavaScript file** in your code editor
2. **Read the TODO comments**
3. **Write your code** where it says "YOUR CODE HERE"
4. **Click the "Run" button** on the webpage
5. **Check results** in both:
   - The webpage output box
   - Browser console (F12)
6. **If it doesn't work**, read the hints at the bottom of each file
7. **Move to next exercise** when done

## ⚡ Tips:

- **Console.log is your friend!** Use it to debug
- **Don't skip exercises** - each builds on previous concepts
- **If stuck for 5+ minutes** - check hints or ask for help
- **Test frequently** - click Run button after each TODO
- **Time yourself** - 1.5 hours total, move on if stuck
