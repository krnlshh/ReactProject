## 💡 Tips

1. **Do exercises in order** - Each builds on the previous
2. **Type the code yourself** - Don't just read
3. **Modify and experiment** - Change values, try new things
4. **Read error messages** - They teach you
5. **Compare JS vs React** - Understand the conversion

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Server won't start?
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Blank page?
- Check browser console (F12)
